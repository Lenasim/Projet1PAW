            <h2>Macarons</h2>
            <p>Macarons are elegant little sandwiches that are made with meringue, almond flour, and buttercream filling. Now that we have that figured out, let’s move on to some history.The first known appearance of the macaron in Europe was all the way back in the Middle Ages. At the time, the macaron was a small sweet made of almonds, egg white and sugar, and was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Even though the French take credit for the macaron, Catherine de’ Medici likely brought the maccherone to France in the 16th century from Italy, where it had been produced in Venetian monasteries since the 8th century. Back then, they were rather humbly called ‘priest’s bellybuttons,’ due to the pastry’s shape.</p>
