    <h3>From lamingtons (Australia) to makroud (Marrocco)</h3>
    <p class="text-concept">My name is Lane MIS and I had my first camera when I was 14 years old. I bought it in a flea market in the suburbs of Melbourne where I come from. I started by taking pictures of everything that brought me happiness in my life. And it is naturally, during a student job in a French pastry shop in Melbourne that I associated my two favourites passions. At the end of my microbiology studies, I had the chance to travel alone around the world. I discovered so many new pastries in each country and region that I decided to combine my trip and pastry! Today I share my favorites and explain to you how to according travel to your favorite pastries!<br>
    Now I devote myself to the development of my work as a photographer specializing in pastries. You can also follow me on social networks to see my latest photos !
